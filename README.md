# Problem Statement
Cappuccino Cafe is a popular local coffee shop, but it struggles to attract new customers and maintain customer loyalty due to a lack of online presence. With the increasing reliance on technology and the growing trend of online ordering, the cafe needs a website to compete with other coffee shops in the area. By creating a website, Cappuccino Cafe can showcase its menu, ambiance, and staff, and provide customers with an easy way to place orders, make reservations, and provide feedback. The website will also enable the cafe to engage with customers and promote its promotions and events, ultimately leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.

# Project Description
The project's objective is to build Cappuccino Cafe a website that will help it establish an online presence and increase consumer involvement. The website will be made to allow consumers to easily place orders, book reservations, and leave reviews while also showcasing the cafe's cuisine, employees, ambiance, promotions, and events. In order to assure scalability and dependability, the website will be created utilizing the most recent web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and it will be hosted on a cloud platform.
The website will have a simple, intuitive user interface that is accessible and easy to use on all platforms, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. The cafe's home page will have a captivating hero image, a synopsis of the cafe's history and core principles, and highlights from the menu. All of the goods offered at Cappuccino Cafe will be listed on the menu page, along with their prices and descriptions, and they will be divided into sections such as appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks.
The about us page will contain details about the proprietors and employees, their love of delivering high-quality meals and beverages, and the cafe's dedication to environmental responsibility. Customers can leave feedback and provide recommendations for the cafe on the feedback page, while the contact us page will have a contact form, a phone number, an email address, and a physical address.
To maintain the privacy and security of user data, the website will be search engine optimized, integrated with social networking platforms, and secured with SSL encryption.

# Note: 

here is an updated step-by-step guide to try database connectivity in this project:

1. Download the code from the GitHub repository that contains the project.

2. Install XAMPP on your computer if it is not already installed. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. It is used to set up and run a local server environment for web development.

3. Once XAMPP is installed, extract the code you downloaded from GitHub and store it in the C:\xampp\htdocs directory. This is the default directory where XAMPP looks for files to serve on the local webserver.

4. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start both Apache and MySQL. Apache is a web server that serves files over HTTP, while MySQL is a database management system that manages databases containing data used by web applications.

5. Open a web browser and type localhost/{folder_name}/src into the address bar, where {folder_name} is the name of the directory where you stored the code in step 3. For example, if the code is stored in a directory called cafe_website, you would type localhost/cafe_website/src.

6. If everything is set up correctly, your website should run properly and you should be able to navigate to the Contact Us page.

7. In the Contact Us page, enter the required data and click on "Submit". This will trigger a database query to the Azure MySQL database.

8. To check the implementation of the Azure MySQL database, you can view the data that was inserted into the database by logging into the Azure portal and navigating to the MySQL database. From there, you can view the data that was inserted and ensure that the database connectivity is working as expected.
