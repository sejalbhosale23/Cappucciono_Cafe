# Note: 

here is an updated step-by-step guide to try database connectivity in this project:

1. Download the code from the GitHub repository that contains the project.

2. Install XAMPP on your computer if it is not already installed. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. It is used to set up and run a local server environment for web development.

3. Once XAMPP is installed, extract the code you downloaded from GitHub and store it in the C:\xampp\htdocs directory. This is the default directory where XAMPP looks for files to serve on the local webserver.

4. Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start both Apache and MySQL. Apache is a web server that serves files over HTTP, while MySQL is a database management system that manages databases containing data used by web applications.

5. Open a web browser and type localhost/{folder_name}/src into the address bar, where {folder_name} is the name of the directory where you stored the code in step 3. For example, if the code is stored in a directory called cafe_website, you would type localhost/cafe_website/src.

6. If everything is set up correctly, your website should run properly and you should be able to navigate to the Contact Us page.

7. In the Contact Us page, enter the required data and click on "Submit". This will trigger a database query to the Azure MySQL database.

8. To check the implementation of the Azure MySQL database, you can view the data that was inserted into the database by logging into the Azure portal and navigating to the MySQL database. From there, you can view the data that was inserted and ensure that the database connectivity is working as expected.
